  afterRecruitInfo: "On the first day you start to think it was a bad idea to let
    an alcholic under age church obsessed singer into your revolution. It's about
    the 3rd day that you finally realize Elijah fit into your group like a glove
    on a cactus. He makes you bless God before each meal, he took plenty of budget
    to make a church in the basment. The good side is that after you kick his ass
    out The team moral is rising\r. \n"
