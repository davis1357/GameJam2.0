    Amalia is an adrenaline junkie afraid of nothing. when she was younger
    she spent most of her days doing extreme sports and living the wild life. now
    she is still living wild as she can. she may be old ( Never ask a woman''s age
    young man) but her spirit is young.'

    you dont know what you are going to do with it. Amalia Knows, and she gives each
    of you a lion that you will ride on the street.\r\nYou are Excited just like
