    Isabella has watched
    all 14 seeason of judge Mody - a fictional Sci fi show where after Modi survives
    ragnarok, he judges all the norse gods for being jerks.'
  afterRecruitInfo: After getting kicked by the mayor from her upcoming role as the
    next supreme judge, she decided to dedicate herself fully to overthrow him. Even
    if it means using everything she knows to operate below the law. She helps the
    revolution in becoming more secretive and escaping the law.Sadly, she is so vengfull
    that people are very much scared of her, bringing down the morale.
