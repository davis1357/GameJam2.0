  afterRecruitInfo: "Benjamin is getting ready to pump those muscles and lift cars.\r\nHe
    starts telling you how you need to get fit and ready towards this revolution.\r\nAt
    4 AM the next morning you all arrive to the workout only to find Benjamin standing
    next to a penguin.\r\nHe tells you to stay calm and he will eventually go away.
    Do not move any muscle. 4 Hours later the penguin collapses and dies.\nBenjamin
    starts to sing We Are the Champions, and right then you notice the hallucination
    shroom\rs.\nGod dammint Benjaman, you made a big rucus, used the budget for shrooms
    and destroyed your reputation all in the same day."
