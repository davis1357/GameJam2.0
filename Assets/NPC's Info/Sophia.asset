    This young techer is very grounded to earth and can
    really help with the revolution while keeping dicipline. On the other hand, no

  afterRecruitInfo: When Sophia get recruited she doesn't waste any time. She starts
    by educating everyone, making everyone apologize when fighting and all of the
    other annoying teacher things available to her. She does not seem to realize
    you are all adult. On one side she makes you all use your money with more caution
    but damn! She is annoying She took down morale.
