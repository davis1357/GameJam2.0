    She
    is the classic perfect, highschool girl that no one likes because she bosses
    them arount to be perfect to her eyes. But she also has a sharp tongue, quick
    thinking and an eye for spotting bullshit.'
  afterRecruitInfo: 'She is getting right to the buisnees!

    She makes Charts
    and awasome infographics about your revolution. She created the finance office
    in the revolution just to create a finance report.

    From her charts you
    see That the situtauion is bad. But hey! You sell the chart template to other
    secret revolutions against crazy mayors.'
